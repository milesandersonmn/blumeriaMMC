The vcf with ancestral calls was subset to include chromosome 1, bp 6.5 million-7.5 million; chromsome 2, bp 6.5 million-7.5 million; and chromosome 6, bp 2.5 million-3.5 million. Then bcftools +fill-tags recalculated all info tags. All sites with AC<1
were pruned. Only SNPs were retained. Only sites without missing data were included. This reduced to 2879 sites.

No allelic depth filter has been used to this point.

Current working file name is ABC_regions_allFilters_3Mbp.vcf.gz
