The vcf with ancestral calls was subset to include chromosome 1, bp 6 million-8 million; chromsome 2, bp 6 million-8 million; and chromosome 6, bp 2 million-5 million. Then bcftools +fill-tags recalculated all info tags. All sites with AC<1
were pruned. Only SNPs were retained. This left 8779 sites. Only sites without missing data were included. This reduced to 7514 sites.

No allelic depth filter has been used to this point.
