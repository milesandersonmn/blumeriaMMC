The vcf with ancestral calls was subset to include chromosome 1, bp 6 million-8 million; chromsome 2, bp 6 million-8 million; and chromosome 6, bp 2 million-5 million. This subset had a total SNP count of 105480. This was filtered to exclude 
all sites with missing data, which reduced the variant count to 101368 SNPs.

No allelic depth filter has been used to this point.
